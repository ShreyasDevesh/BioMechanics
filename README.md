# ABSTRACT
In this work, we measure the excitation of muscles during the lower limb movement in a standard and 
microgravity environment. The space-replicating climate has been created within the 
constraints of an earthen boundary using exoskeletons for elbow flexion.

This can be performed using OpenSIM an open-source tool to work with biomechanical systems given tracking data.
We perform Motion Capture using an 8-camera Optitrack system and use this for performing analysis in OpenSIM. We then edit the environmental constraints 
(especially the gravitational acceleration) and change it to the order of 10^-3 mimicking zero gravity. We validate our data with surface EMG data with an 
exoskeleton and conclude our findings.
