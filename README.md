In this work, we measure the excitation of muscles during the upper limb movement in a standard and 
microgravity environment. The space-replicating environment has been created within the 
constraints of an earthen boundary using exoskeletons for shoulder flexion. We plan to validate the 
simulation results in open-source software called OpenSim, using data obtained from motion
capture of the activity and the results from an EMG sensor physically placed in the upper limb 
region. We can portray the drastic differences in muscle activity in a typical 
environment and when subjected to microgravity. The motion dynamics of the muscle involved
will vary between the two environments, which will be analysed through OpenSim. Both results
will be compared to prove the effectiveness of using Opensim software for 
microgravity conditions related to experimental setups in space technology fields.
