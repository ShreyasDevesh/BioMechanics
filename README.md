In this work, we measure the excitation of muscles during the arm movement in a normal and 
microgravity environment. The space replicating environment has been created within the 
constraints of earthen boundary using exoskeletons for upper limb. We plan to validate the 
results of simulation in an open-source software called OpenSim with data obtained from motion 
capture of the activity with the results from an EMG sensor physically placed in the upper limb 
region. We will be able to portray the drastic differences in the muscle activity in normal 
environment and when subjected to microgravity. The dynamics of motion of the muscle involved 
will vary between the two environments which will be analysed through OpenSim. The results 
obtained from both will be compared to prove the effectiveness of using Opensim software for 
microgravity conditions related to experimental setups in space technology fields.
